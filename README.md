# Credit-card-fraud-detection
Capstone Project
The dataset for this project is obtained from Kaggle repository, link for the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection. The data set is provided by Vesta's realworld e-commerce transactions.
Credit card fraud can happen by physical theft of cards / data information breach virtually via imposters / hackers. The major challenge in this field is the huge size of data, millions of transactions are processed every day which has a lot of imbalanced data i.e. generally more than 99% are legitimate cases. In this project, I am building a model-binary classifier that will detect fraud transactions efficiently. 
Feature selection and feature engineering plays a significant role for improving the output performance, especially for a dataset with large number of attributes. This is a high dimensional data set containing 435 attributes. I am using various dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal component analysis, Filter, Wrapper, Embedded, Hybrid and comparing the performance of various machine learning algorithms on these techniques.
